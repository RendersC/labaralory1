## This project has a main class Main and functions in it, each function is a solution to each problem


# In this project functions such as:
minValue(int n, int[] arr) – Finds the minimum value in an array.

avgValue(int n, int[] arr) – Calculates the average value of the array elements.

isPrime(int num, int divisor) – Checks whether a number is prime.

factorial(int n) – Computes the factorial of n.

power(int base, int exponent) – Raises base to the power of exponent.

fibonacci(int n) – Computes the n-th Fibonacci number.

reverseArray(int[] arr, int left, int right) – Recursively reverses an array.

isDigitString(String str, int index) – Checks if a string consists only of digits.

binomialCoefficient(int n, int k) – Computes the binomial coefficient C(n, k).

gcd(int a, int b) – Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

BIG O were also calculated.
